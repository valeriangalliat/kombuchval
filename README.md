## 💡 Philosophy

I've experimented with a number of things in kombucha, not only fruits,
but also milkshake kombucha (lactose and vanilla), or even dry hopped
ones. But I've found that **the kombuchas I grew to drink everyday are
the most simple ones**.

My goal is to brew **just a couple of simple recipes that you won't get
tired of**, instead of having plenty of different tastes that you need
to rotate between all the time to stay satisfied.

Initially for the sake of simplicity, **all the kombucha is cold
brewed**, meaning that the tea is steeped overnight in cold water. This
also gives this kombucha a unique signature taste that I fell in love
with at the first sip!

Finally, **kombucha is cheap to make, and therefore should be cheap to
buy**. I want this kombucha to be one you can afford to drink everyday.

## ☃  Why cold brew?

Since a year I've been brewing kombucha the most common way, that is,
boiling water, steeping the tea with the sugar, then cooling it down and
fermenting it.

This was fine, but boiling water was taking a while, and cooling the hot
tea before fermenting was even longer, and I wanted to optimize the
process.

By cold brewing, I eliminate both of those steps. I was especially
curious to know what cold brew kombucha would taste like as I've never
heard of anything like this before, and I've also been really into cold
brew coffee and tea lately.

It turns out that it tastes amazing. I'm in love with my cold brew mate
kombucha since I started brewing it a couple of months ago and I'm not
getting tired of it. I drink a pint of it every morning and I still
enjoy every sip of it.

If you live on Montreal and want to taste the deliciousness of cold brew
kombucha, hit me up and I can put aside a couple of bottles from the
next batch for you!

## 📙 History

It all started in November 2020, when I brewed my first ever batch of
kombucha [in this video](https://youtu.be/Ba7bbBnlnoE).

I wasn't a big kombucha drinker before then, mostly because I used to
drink ([and brew](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/sans-pression)) a
lot of beer, and because I found commercial kombucha too expensive.

But at some point I decided to do something with my life and drinking
one beer or more everyday was not anymore an option. That's when I
looked more closely at kombucha.

Out of curiosity I got a SCOBY from my brewer associate and started my
own batch. I liked the resulted and decided to keep doing it, trying a
number of flavors.

The two that I kept brewing over and over are orange pekoe and yerba
mate, both cold brewed, and without any extras. They're too god for
selfishly keeping them to myself. We'll see where this leads us.

## ❓ What is this repo?

That's mostly for me to organize the brewing schedule and store the
history of batches, number the bottles and keep track of everything.

Since I currently can't put a lot of information on the physical bottle
labels, you can just come here with your unique bottle number and find
all the details about it.
