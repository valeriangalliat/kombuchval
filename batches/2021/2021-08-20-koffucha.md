## Notes

Unlike in the current version of the recipe, this batch was brewed with
167 g of coffee to reach a 1:17 ratio based on 3 quarts of water (2.839
L).

On 2021-09-04, added 1/2 cup of extra starter, because the 1 tablespoon
in the recipe I followed seem to be way too little, it's barely
fermenting.
